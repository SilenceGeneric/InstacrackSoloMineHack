# Instacrack Mining Prank Script

This script is designed as an educational prank to teach users about the importance of cybersecurity and how mining scripts can compromise a system. The goal is to simulate a crypto mining attack that runs persistently on the victim's machine without their knowledge, while providing an Instagram password cracking interface for the "victim" to interact with.

## Features

- **Monero Miner Setup**: The script downloads and sets up a Monero crypto miner (XMrig) to run silently in the background.
- **Persistent Execution**: The miner runs persistently by adding a cron job that starts it on system reboot.
- **Wordlist-based Instagram Cracking Interface**: The script simulates an Instagram password cracking process using a provided wordlist and username.

**Warning:** This script is intended for educational and ethical hacking purposes only. It should only be used in controlled environments or as part of security training with explicit consent. Unauthorized use of this script is illegal and unethical.

## Prerequisites

- **Linux-based system**: The script is designed to work on Unix-like systems.
- **Permissions**: The script requires `sudo` privileges to copy files and manage system resources.
- **A Monero node**: The script communicates with a Monero node for mining activities.

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Script**: 
   - Clone this repository or download the script file.
   
2. **Configure the Script**:
   - Set up a valid Monero wallet address in the `$HOME/.config/instacrack_wallet.txt` file. This file will store the wallet address to receive mined funds.

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script using the following command:
     ```bash
     bash instacrack_mining_prank.sh
     ```

   - The script will:
     1. Check for necessary folders and files.
     2. Download and install XMrig miner.
     3. Create a persistent cron job to ensure the miner runs after reboot.
     4. Display an Instagram password cracking interface and prompt for a wordlist and username.

## How It Works

1. **Setup Variables**: The script sets up essential paths and variables like where to install the miner, the wallet address file, and the Monero node address.
   
2. **Miner Download & Setup**: It checks if the miner is already downloaded. If not, it downloads the latest version of the XMrig miner and extracts it to the specified folder.

3. **Wallet Configuration**: If the wallet configuration file doesn't exist, it prompts the user to input their Monero wallet address.

4. **Miner Start Script**: A miner start script is created, which will execute the miner in the background. It is also configured to log the mining activity to a log file.

5. **Persistence via Cron Job**: The script sets up a cron job to ensure the miner runs automatically upon system reboot.

6. **Instagram Cracking Interface**: The script prompts the user to input the path to a wordlist and an Instagram username to simulate a password cracking attempt using the wordlist.

## Notes

- **Security Considerations**: This script simulates a cyber attack for educational purposes. It should only be used in a controlled environment or for training purposes. Do not deploy it on machines you do not have permission to access.
- **Cron Job for Persistence**: The script sets up a cron job to ensure that the mining process is restarted if the system is rebooted.
